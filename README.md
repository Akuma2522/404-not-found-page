## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img src="scarecrow.png" />
```

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 1200px) {
  .img-container {
    width: 600px;
  }

### Continued development

For future projects, I will focus on image optimization to ensure fast loading times. I'll also explore more about implementing CSS to improve the user experience.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Mono:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap) - This helped me with the font style reason.
